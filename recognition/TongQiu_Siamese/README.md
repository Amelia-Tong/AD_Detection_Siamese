# Siamese Network for AD Detaction

In this project, we leveraged Siamese Networks, a metric learning technich, to classify Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from 2D MRI scans.

## Dataset

**Source**: 
- [ADNI dataset](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/L6bbssKhUoUdTSI) for Alzheimerâ€™s disease.

**Classes**:
- AD (Alzheimer's Disease)
- CN (Cognitively Normal)

**Training Data**: 
- AD: 10,400 images (520 patients)
- CN: 11,120 images (556 subjects)

Training data is split into training and validation sets using an 8:2 ratio, ensuring a patient-level split.

To train the Siamese network, datasets are constructed in both pairwise and triplet formats. 

**Testing Data**:
- AD: 4,460 images (223 patients)
- CN: 4,540 images (227 subjects)

The test set is reserved for final model evaluation.
